# Yggdrasil
A genericized character creation tool written in R as a learning project.
Run the entire file, and invoke CharGen() to work. Some things may be commented out temporarily as I work on them.


The intent of this project is to learn enough R and OOP to be useful to people, show off my skills eventually, and potentially helping out TTRPG'ers everywhere and indie TTRPG games as I go.
