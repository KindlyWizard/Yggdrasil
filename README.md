A genericized character creation tool written in R as a learning project.
Run the entire file, and invoke CharGen() to work. Some things may be commented out temporarily as I work on them.


The intent of this project is to learn enough R and OOP to be useful to people, show off my skills eventually, and potentially helping out TTRPG'ers everywhere and indie TTRPG games as I go. 

Here's my Kanban-esque project board: https://trello.com/b/wlsVY7HE/chargen
And I'm blogging about this on my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/geoffrey-gill-29026761/
