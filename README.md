A genericized character creation tool written in R as a learning project.
Some things may be commented out temporarily as I work on them.

Base.r has the core functionality and loads the rest of the modules. Run it and invoke CharGen() to get a character.

The end goals, in order, are:
1) Gain some new skills (So far, R, VSCode, GitHub, OOP in general, eventually I want it to have a web-front end with configurable character sheet output)
2) Make a potentially useful tool for players
3) Make a potentially useful tool for indie TTRPG makers
4) As a demonstration for employers
5) Potentially monetize it eventually (if this ever comes to pass, it's got to be in a friendly, scalable fashion)
